                <h3 class="title">Question 1</h3>
                <br><br>
                <p> The original prototype of the Palm Pilot, known as the "Palm Taxi," was actually a block of wood!</p>
                <br><br>
                <p> The Co-Founder used this simple wooden block as a stand-in for the device to simulate how people might use a portable digital assistant. He wanted to determine if a handheld device for organizing information would feel comfortable and practical in daily use</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box" style="background-color: #d8675a;">
                <h3 class="title">Question 2</h3>
                <br><br>
                <p>A product prototype is a tangible model of a physical or digital item created to simulate its appearance, functionality, and usability, allowing developers to test and refine the product before production. This type of prototype focuses on evaluating aspects like ergonomics, features, and design</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>A service prototype is less about a physical object and more about testing interactions within a service experience. It focuses on simulating and evaluating the steps of a service, often through role-playing or scripted scenarios</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box" style="background-color: #e95f3d;">
                <h3 class="title">Question 3</h3>
                <br><br>
                <p>Low-fidelity prototypes are simple, often non-functional models used to represent the basic design and flow of a product or service. Theyâ€™re typically created with inexpensive materials, like paper, or are digital wireframes that lack detailed graphics, animations, or interactive elements. Their simplicity allows designers to communicate the general layout, structure, and user flow of an idea without the commitment of detailed development.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>A great example is the aformentioned "Palm Taxi" </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="box" style="background-color: #d8675a;">
                <h3 class="title">Question 4</h3>
                <br><br>
                <p>High-fidelity prototypes are highly detailed, interactive models of a product that closely resemble the final design and user experience. These prototypes include realistic visuals, interactive elements, animations, and accurate content</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>One key disadvantage of high-fidelity prototypes is that they can be time-consuming and resource-intensive to create, which can slow down the design process.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box" style="background-color: #e95f3d;">
                <h3 class="title">Question 5</h3>
                <br><br>
                <p>Q1: Does the metaphor resonate with the target users?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Q2: Is the metaphor intuitive and easy to understand?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Q3: Does the metaphor align with the functions and features of the product?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Q4: Is the metaphor scalable and adaptable?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Q5: Is the metaphor culturally appropriate and inclusive?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box" style="background-color: #dd241ab1;">
                <h3 class="title">Question 6</h3>
                <br><br>
                <p>Microsoft's Inclusive Design guide on "Respecting Focus" highlights how to create respectful and accessible user experiences by minimizing unnecessary distractions and preserving user focus.</p>
                <br><br>    
                <p>It emphasizes techniques like reducing unexpected sounds or pop-ups, prioritizing relevant content, and providing clear paths for interaction. The guide encourages designers to be mindful of diverse attention spans and cognitive needs, fostering experiences that are engaging without overwhelming.</p>
