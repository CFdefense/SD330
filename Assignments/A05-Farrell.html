                The 6 issues we need to focus on are goal setting, identifying participants, the relationship between the data  collector and the data  provider, ethical considerations of collecting data, triangulation, and pilot studies. 
                <li>Goal Setting: Establishing clear objectives is crucial for data gathering, as it defines the purpose and direction of the study, ensuring that the data collected aligns with the intended outcomes.</li>
                <li>Identifying Participants: Carefully selecting the appropriate participants is essential to ensure that the data collected is representative and relevant, which directly impacts the validity and reliability of the findings.</li>
                <li>Relationship Between Data Collector and Data Provider: Understanding the dynamics between the data collector and the data provider is important, as this relationship can influence the quality of the data, including factors like trust and communication.</li>
                <li>Ethical Considerations: Adhering to ethical guidelines when collecting data is vital to protect participants' rights and privacy, fostering trust and encouraging honest and accurate responses.</li>
                <li>Triangulation: Utilizing multiple methods or sources of data (triangulation) enhances the credibility and validity of the findings by cross-verifying information and reducing bias.</li>
                <li>Pilot Studies: Conducting pilot studies allows researchers to test their data collection methods on a smaller scale, helping to identify potential issues and refine the approach before the full study is implemented.</li>

                    The 6 Data Techniques are all very effective and can all be used to create a Marist Parking Application
                    <li>Interviews: Conducting interviews allows for in-depth exploration of user experiences and needs related to parking.</li>
                    <li>Focus Groups: Focus groups facilitate discussions among diverse participants to identify common themes and conflicting opinions about parking features. </li>
                    <li>Questionnaires: Distributing questionnaires enables the collection of quantitative and qualitative data from a larger audience about their parking preferences and frustrations. </li>
                    <li>Direct Observation in the Wild: Observing users in their natural parking environments provides valuable insights into real-time behaviors and challenges they face.</li>
                    <li>Direct Observation in a Controlled Environment: Usability testing in a controlled setting allows researchers to capture detailed interactions with the app prototype without external distractions. </li>
                    <li> Indirect Observation: Using indirect observation methods, such as automated logging or participant diaries, helps gather long-term data on parking behaviors without influencing users' actions. </li>

                    <strong> Differences: </strong> A <strong>persona</strong> is a fictional character that represents a user type, helping designers understand user needs, behaviors, and motivations. In contrast, a <strong>scenario</strong> is a narrative that describes how a persona interacts with a product to achieve a specific goal, illustrating user experience and workflows.
                    <br /> 
                    <strong> Similarities: </strong>Personas and scenarios are similar in that both are tools used in user-centered design to improve understanding of users and their needs. They both rely on research and data to inform design decisions, ensuring that products are tailored to real user experiences and contexts.`;
