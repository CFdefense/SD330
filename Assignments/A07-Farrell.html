    <div class="box"><b>1. Explain Anthony Ortony's model of emotional design -> </b>
        Anthony Ortony's model of emotional design, known as the OCC model, explains how emotions are generated through the evaluation or appraisal of events, 
        agents, and objects. It categorizes emotions into three types: event-based, agent-based, and object-based. The model suggests that emotions arise based 
        on how individuals assess the outcomes of events, the actions of others, or their attraction to objects.

    <div class="box"><b>5. Describe how an app can express anthropomorphism.  What is your opinion of apps/webpages that do so? -> </b>
        An app can express anthropomorphism by giving human-like qualities to non-human elements, such as virtual assistants, animated characters, or even inanimate UI components. 
        n my opinion, anthropomorphism can enhance user engagement by making the interaction feel more personal and relatable, especially in apps like virtual assistants or customer support bots. However, when overdone or implemented poorly, it can come off as gimmicky or even irritating.

    <div class="box"><b>4. Watch the videos in "Activity 6.3 (5th edition textbook)" or "Activity 6.4 (6th edition textbook)". What are your opinions? -> </b>
        I think that those concepts highlight a very important driving factor in us as humans. Humans thrive for joy and fun and features which play into this desire are successful.
