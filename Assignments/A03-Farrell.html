                <strong>Main Concepts & Metaphors</strong> - A paperback book &#128218 uses physical metaphors like "pages" and "chapters" that are familiar and tactile. An ebook uses similar metaphors (pages, bookmarks) but in a digital form, allowing for navigation through virtual pages. 
                <br />
                <strong>Differences</strong> - An ebook replicates the reading experience but adds functionalities like adjustable font sizes, search capabilities, and digital bookmarking. These features offer convenience but may reduce the tactile pleasure of a physical book.
                <br />
                <strong>Paper Informs Digital</strong> - Concepts such as pages, chapters, bookmarks, table of contents, and text formatting have inspired digital.
                <br />
                <strong>New Functionality</strong> - Real-time navigation, traffic updates, voice guidance, location sharing, and route suggestions based on current conditions.
                <br />
                <strong>What is Difficult?</strong> - Digital Navigation is comparatively harder on digital media compared to holding a physical book where it is all intuitive.
                <br />
                <strong>Pros</strong> - Portability, Accessibility, Interactive Features, and Cross Device Compatability.
                <br />
                <strong>Cons</strong> - Loss of Tangibility, Screen Fatigue, and Battery Dependancy.
