        <h2> Question 1 </h2>
        <h4><i> Imagine you want to create a parking app for Marist students. What are the activities you would do using the (Design Council's) 'double diamond' approach? </i></h4>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Discover</b> -> Investigate the current parking situation and query the student and faculty population as to their satisfaction and desires.</li>
            <li> <b>Define</b> -> Using information and data discovered in the first phase we must identify the core issue at hand with the parking system </li>
            <li> <b>Develop</b> -> We then brain storm different methods to solve the problem proposed in the previous phase </li>
            <li> <b>Deliver</b> -> We implement the proposed solution and have users test it and compare to the previous solution for satisfaction </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Question 2 </h2>
        <h4><i> What are Dan Saffer's four approaches to interaction design - and a short description of each?  Which approach suits your software development style best? </i></h4>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>User Centered Design (UCD)</b> -> Involves collaboraitng, quering and testing with users throughout all steps of the sesign process </li>
            <li> <b>Activity Centered Design (ACD)</b> -> Based in the tasks or activities users preform with the application, The design process revolves around optimizing these activities to make them as efficient and effective as possible. </li>
            <li> <b>Systems Design</b> -> Looks at the application design from a broader perspective. It considers the entire system of interactions, including infrastructure, processes, and the relationships between different components of the application.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Genius Design</b> -> In this approach designers rely on their own experience to implement the application without user input, the idea here is that the designers know the users best. </li>
        </ul>
        <medium>My approach which fits my style the best would be a mesh between Genius Design and User Centered Design, in the fact that I often query the user for some basic requirements and needs and then from there I can flesh out the rest on my own. </medium>

        <h2> Question 3 </h2>
        <h4><i> What is "cooperative design" and how does it fit in with what you know about Agile? </i></h4>
        <ul>
            <li> <b> Cooperative Design</b> is a design process which aims to actively involve all stakeholders in a project, the goal is to have the users contribute a great deal towards the product they will be using</li>
            <li> <b>Cooperative Design Relates to Agile</b> because Agile is a methodology focused on flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development, which aligns closely with the principles of cooperative design. Much like Cooperative Design, Agile includes the users feedback and requirements. To integrate Cooperative Design into Agile, users can be influential throughout more than just the sprint planning and requirment idenfication phase.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Question 4 </h2>
        <h4><i> Watch the short referenced video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-DLQp9xb20 Which future changes do you think are most important.  Do you think the changes address real ATM problems?  Can you think of other problems/solutions? </i></h4>
        <ul>
            <li> ... </li>
            <li> ... </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Question 5 </h2>
        <h4><i> Look at Activity 2.5 and analyze NETFLIX for the seven listed characteristics.  (If you have textbook edition 5, the seventh characteristic is satisfaction.) </i></h4>
        <ul>
            <li> ... </li>
            <li> ... </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Question 6 </h2>
        <h4><i> Jot down some notes so you're prepared to discuss the section: "Dilemma: Copying for Inspiration: Is it Legal" </i></h4>
        <ul>
            <li> ... </li>
            <li> ... </li>
        </ul>
